              This course satisfies the semester (0.5) of Digital Studies to
              graduate. It also offers a broad experience and is recommended for
              those who want to try a lot of things or aren't excited about any
              one class in particular.

            <p>
              This course is directed towards students who want to learn to
              build a specific type of project (i.e. a website, app, game, or
              program). Note that you also need a year (1.0) of CTE credits to
              graduate, and taking any CS courses in addition to a semester of
              Digital Studies can help get you there.

            <p>
              This course has prerequisites, but students who are ready to move
              quickly may join case-by-case. By the end of this course, students
              who put the work in will be prepared for CS jobs and higher
              education.
