        CTE Pathways are sets of courses designed by the state of Utah to help you be college and career ready. 
        Mr. Buckley has a strong connection for web development internships for those who complete the Web Development Pathway. 
        Completing the Programming & Software Development Pathway is perhaps the best way to prepare for a college CS major.
        Finally, the IT Support Specialist Pathway is not an official CTE Pathway, but prepares you for an IT certification 
        equivalent to A+ that can get you an IT job right out of high school (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://w3.testout.com/certification/pro-exams/pc-pro">more info</a>).
