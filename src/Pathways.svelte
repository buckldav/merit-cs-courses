        Any one of these pathways can help you be college and career ready. 
        Mr. Buckley has a strong connection for web development internships for those who complete the web development pathway. 
        The IT support pathway can legitimately get you an IT job out of high school because the certification carries real weight. 
        Completing AP Computer Science A is perhaps the best way to prepare for a college CS major.
