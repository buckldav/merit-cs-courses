  <h2>Behavior Expectations</h2>

  <p>
    We will go over these more in depth in class. I am trusting that you will
    behave well and use your time wisely.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Do not misuse or damage school equipment (see <a
        href="https://meritprepacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Internet-Policy.pdf"
        >Merit’s AUP</a
      >, fines may apply for damages).
    </li>
    <li>
      Give your attention to the person talking. Eye contact, no headphones.
    </li>
    <li>Don’t distract yourself or others from learning.</li>
    <li>
      If you get your work done and continue to follow the above rules, you are
      free.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Computer and Technology Use</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>When You Arrive in Class</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Look at the board for the itinerary.</li>
      <li>
        Open Canvas and any other websites/apps required to do the day's work.
      </li>
      <li>
        When Mr. Buckley starts class, it's time to eliminate distractions and
        begin.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Eliminate Distractions</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No Phones, AirPods, or YouTube. I will follow <a

          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Merit's phone policy</a
        >. You may ask to use for phone for something like two-factor
        authentication or other essential use.
      </li>
      <li>I will help you manage distractions in whatever way is necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Music</li>
    <ul>
      <li>No headphones/listening to music when we are together as a class.</li>
      <li>
        When you are doing independent work, you may use Pandora, Spotify,
        music.youtube.com, or other online music streaming. You may use your own
        earbuds or the class headphones.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Free Time</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Free time begins at a designated time by Mr. Buckley. If you finish the
        day's assignment early, work on another task like Codecademy or other
        school work until the appointed time. If we reach free time and you are
        still not done with the day's work, I expect you to finish the work
        first.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may read, or draw. You may also do suggested computer activities,
        including: NitroType, coolmathgames, Scratch, Adobe Creative Suite (and
        equivalent creative tools), Code.org, codecombat.com, typing.com.
      </li>
      <li>If you are unsure if an activity is appropriate, ask Mr. Buckley.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
