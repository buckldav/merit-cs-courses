  <h3>Student Accounts</h3>
  <p>
    Your student may need to create at least one online account to use the web
    applications we use to assist in learning. All web applications are approved
    through the school. Students will not be allowed to use sensitive personal
    information (like birthday, address, phone) in these accounts. BY SIGNING
    BELOW, you are consenting that your student may create these online accounts
    through this class. If you have questions, please email me at
    <a href="mailto:david.buckley@meritacademy.org"
      >david.buckley@meritacademy.org</a
    >. Finally, if students consistently misuse computers, they will be referred
    to administration.
